# FlyRank Task Manager API

A simple, in-memory to-do list CRUD API built with Python and FastAPI. This project was developed step-by-step through six progressive development stages.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To install and run the API locally in under 5 minutes:

### 1. Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Python 3.10+ installed, then run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Start the API Server
Run the Uvicorn development server:
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

The server will start at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
